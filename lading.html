            In the near future, the unmanned Pilgrim 7 space probe returns
            from Mars to Earth orbit with soil samples potentially containing 
            evidence of extraterrestrial life. The probe is captured and its 
            samples retrieved by the International Space Station and its
           six-member crew. Exobiologist Hugh Derry, who is paralyzed from
            the waist down, revives a dormant cell from the sample,
             which quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that
             American school children name "Calvin". Hugh realizes 
             that Calvin's cells can change their specialisation,
            acting as muscle, sensor, and neuron cells all at once.
